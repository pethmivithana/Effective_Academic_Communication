Hello everyone! Welcome to the first session of your English course. This course is designed as a support system to help students improve their English proficiency, a necessary skill for your future academic journey at SLIIT. The course primarily focuses on speaking skills and will provide you with many enjoyable activities to practice English. 

You may have completed your school education in Sinhala or Tamil medium, but now you are at a turning point in life—your university education, where your degree is entirely in English. This means that all your assessments will also be in English. Therefore, we believe this course will help you develop your communication skills, which will ultimately lead to better grades. 

Now, let’s discuss the structure of the course.

    We completed our very first lesson today! The main focus of the lesson was to provide you with background information about the program and what we will be doing in the future. We also covered the lesson on “Self-Introductions,” which will be very helpful for getting to know each other at university.
